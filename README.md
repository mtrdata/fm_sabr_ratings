# FMoneyball - data cleaning & the creation of a new rating

In this project, I extracted data from Football Manager as a HTML file. I then clean & processed the data using Python (Pandas) before using a Linear Regression model (NumPy, Sci-Kit Learn) to determine which variables impacted the game's Rating system for each position. 

I then applied the variables importance as a metric weight before taking into consideration the amount of minutes a player played that season and the quality of the league they played in to create a new rating titled SABR Rating. Furthermore, I looked at the mean of the new rating across various seasons and created a comparison column, original rating minus the new rating, to highlight the difference between the two.

'Challenges & Aims'
- Converting and cleaning data
- Improve my object-oriented programming skills
- Improve my model building skills with Sci-Kit Learn
